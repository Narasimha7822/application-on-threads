# application-on-threads
Our main objective is to carefully understand the various applications of  threads, specifically that of multithreading. To study how these are used  and to be able to use these methods ourselves. We have given five  problems in which threads are used to understand. And then, to solve a  new problem using threads. These five problems give us a good idea on how to use threads and how these problems are approached. We chose to discuss the Reader/Writer, Dinning Philosopher, Producer and Consumer, Doctor-Patient problem  and Cigarette-Smokers problem. The problem that we chose can be solved using the concept of the  Cigarette smokerâ€˜s problem and Semaphores. We have used C language  to solve the given problem
